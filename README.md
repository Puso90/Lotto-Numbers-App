# Lotto-Numbers-App
Get random Numbers and in future most probable outcomes from random games

# Project outline:
I wanted to make a User Interface that was as simple as possible.  A beta version that was as basic as possible but had the software/ coding to satisfy a basic solution.

# Problem:
Create a simple mobile / web app that allows users to generate random lottery numbers.  Seven numbers, which are describes as six numbers plus a bonus number.

# Solution:
1. HTML/CSS: basic user interface.  Not much design and visual graphics.  Plain and simple.
2. JavaScript: wrote a basic solution to create random numbers from min 1 to 52 max, using [ randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 49 ) + 1 ] within an array.  Plus make sure numbers aren't duplicating on the user interface
3. Add Save and Share buttons.  To help users share lucky numbers with friends and family, as well as save numbers they would like to later refer to or not lose.

   # Save Button: (login option)
      1. Should save numbers below the border of the app.
      2. When saved number is clicked, it should give option of sharing or be deleted

   # Share Button: (login option)
      1. The lucky number should be shareable to social media directly.
      2. A link that is clickable should bring the clicker to the web app with the share number visible at the bottom as "shared with"
      3. The link share on social media should appear as a card with Lucky Lotto Number Image, branding, message and number visible. 

4. Newsletter signups/ option for marketing, engagement and attraction purposes.
