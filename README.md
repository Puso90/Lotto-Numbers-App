# Lotto-Numbers-App
Get random Numbers and in future most probable outcomes from random games

# Project outline:
I wanted to make a User Interface that was as simple as possible.  A beta version that was as basic as possible but had the software/ coding to satisfy a basic solution.

# Problem:
Create a simple mobile / web app that allows users to generate random lottery numbers.  Seven numbers, which are describes as six numbers plus a bonus number.

# Solution:
1. HTML/CSS: basic user interface.  Not much design and visual graphics.  Plain and simple.
2. JavaScript: wrote a basic solution to create random numbers from min 1 to 49 max, using [ randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 49 ) + 1 ] within an array.  Plus make sure numbers aren't duplicating on the user interface
