                <p> In <i>Monopoly</i>, there is this thing called chance.  
                    As in the game, such is life. 
                    We all get a chance sometimes, however our job is to create chance sebaka(for longer).

              <p> <b>Abstract:</b>  A purely unconditional use of random number generator for lotto players.
                  This is to create an unlinked to any lotto and gambling entity and an untainted application 
                  that can be used or not by people trying to generate some chance. 
                <br><br>
                  <b>Roadmap:</b>  <br><br>
                  
                  <i>Probability:</i> 
                      On top of users power to generate unlimited random number sets. 
                      We help narrow the stakes.  
                      Researching the best probability equation 
                      that would acutely predict outcomes 
                      with less number sets generated.
                <br><br>
                      <i>Deep Learning:</i>
                          On top of probalistic outcomes on number sets,
                          we are looking to coumpound this with learning the outcomes
                          of the past lottery winning numbers history.  
                          To make sense of individual numbers with high probability of 
                          which make an appearance and when.
                          <i>(In theory)</i>
